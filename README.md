Hello there, and welcome to our program!

Program Description: Personal Finance Tracker

To break this down in a synopsis, this program
will track how much money a user has in total
from specific income resources. Then, similar to
a budget sheet, depending on how much money gets
tracked, will be subtracted by the amount of 
expenses that the money gets spent on. At the very
end, once the expense exchanges have been made, the
system will show and determine how much money is left over
after the user pays for their expenses.

Instructions: How to use the program

1. Type in whatever your income resource is and add it to the list.
It can be either one or more income resources that can be tracked
and provide an estimated amount on how much money is earned from that
income resource monthly.

2. Do the same thing for expenses from Step One, except provide
the amount that each expense costs in general that has to be spent
every month.

3. If necessary, you can categorize the type of income you receive
and see how much money is left over based on the type of income that
is applied to the number of expenses you want to spend money on.
For example: Full-Time Employment, Part-Time Employment, Self-Employed,
Gifts, and other Miscellaneous jobs.

4. Same thing for expenses from Step Three, except expenses would be categorized
based on: Rent, Utilities, Gas, Food, and Public Services (among other miscellaneous
expenses that can be specified by search).

5. Once everything is either categorized/uncategorized or listed between Income and Expenses,
click the submit button to see the remainder of the money you have after your expenses have
been paid for. The system will ask if you want to continue using the program as much as necessary until
you're ready to discontinue.

Project Setup: How it all started

I, Jaylon West, have gone ahead and created this repository a month in advance when it was time to start
working on the project ahead of time before it was due up until its deadline. Upon making this repository, I
had Python code references on standby whenever the time came to put specific code into the program at the time.
Then, Ender Pillsbury went ahead and started working on the HTML interface for the entire project and all the
code using Visual Studio Code for everything behind the scenes. Our chosen language was JavaScript, since it was
more appropriate and recommended for use in dealing with this project depending on what we had to incorporate
that would make this project run effectively. I, Jaylon West, was responsible for making sure everything was
organized in the right order of progression (while assisting with some code aspects for the project despite
my lack of knowledge of the JavaScript language), and Ender Pillsbury was in charge of the entire code
database for the project so that it can run the way it should.

Clean Code Principles: Code Etiquette Applied

1. Meaningful Names: We gave a lot of the variables used in the code names that are
easy to understand and what their main purposes were. We did the same for Classes, Functions, and Arrays.

2. Simple Functions: We simplified our functions to where they would be tasked with handling at least one or
possibly two tasks at one time while having limited parameters in them as arguments.

3. Error Handling: Because JavaScript comes with an automatic error-handling system of code,
it would handle the many errors we receive as feedback whenever things go wrong in the testing process.
However, just for reassurance, we implemented a data-type checker in case the user types in the wrong data type
for a particular field.

4. Refactoring: Once all of our main code was in, we reviewed it several times and created at least
one or two more branches for testing and refactoring in case we wanted to change something in a particular
code section for the entire project. We would only refactor if we feel as though there is too much unnecessary code
in particular spots that would be too much for another user or developer to understand better.

5. Testing: We have gone back to back with testing the code throughout the entire project. From the beginning
of the project, to the middle, and at the very end we have tested throughout the entire process to make sure everything
was working as we progressed. We made sure everything in the project was working properly before finalizing all the code
that was there.
